# Ubiquiti and Cisco Meraki Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Cisco Meraki and Ubiquiti (including UniFi and various other product lines) are two of the most widely-recognized and utilized platforms available in the current hardware market for cloud-managed network management solutions (e.g., access points, routers, switches) intended for organizations of varied sizes. However, their philosophies and emphases are different: while the Meraki platform is based on subscription-model cloud, network security, and automation technologies, Ubiquiti places more focus on on-premises network management solutions that are of a traditional pricing model, with higher expectation of user setup/configuration. This guide will compare and contrast both platforms and their prospective target audiences.
