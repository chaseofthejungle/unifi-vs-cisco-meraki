# Ubiquiti and Cisco Meraki Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Cisco Meraki and Ubiquiti (including UniFi and various other product lines) are two of the most widely-recognized and utilized platforms available in the current hardware market, providing network management and security solutions (e.g., access points, routers, switches) for organizations of varied sizes. However, their philosophies and emphases are different: while the Meraki platform is based on subscription-model cloud, network security, and automation technologies, Ubiquiti places more focus on on-premises network management solutions that are of a traditional pricing model, with higher expectation of user setup/configuration. This guide will compare and contrast both platforms and their prospective target audiences.
